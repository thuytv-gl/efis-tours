----------
- I meet him at pickup location 10 a bit too early
- I planed to greet him with a Japanese dialog but unsuccessful because he saw me first and came up and introduce himself
- We start walking and make a plan for where to go
- He did not have any places in mind yet but he want to buy a pair of sandals so I open map and look for the nearest Biti's store
- We headed to the store, it's about 2km away so we start doing some small talk
- He ask me about the traffic, complaint about the hot weather, show told me that he arrived yesterday and walk by himself around the hotel
- On the way we pass by the train street right at the time a train arrive
- I ask him about staying and watch the next one, he was excited.
- We pick a coffee shop near and sit and talk for more than an hour about Vietnam and Japan and the differences
- His English is not good so it took a lot of attempt to explain to each other about something.
- After the second train arrived, we continue our journey to the Bitit's store
- The store is near Temple of Literature so I advise him to visit, he was pleased.
- Arrive at the place I tried to talk about the place but he told me his English vocabulary is not enough to understand
- Therefore we just walk and sightseeing the place
- There was a Art gallery of Vietnamese painting at the time, he is a graduated art student so there is something for him to enjoy.
- We end the tour shortly after that
- It's a new experience for me, we keep in touch days after the tour.
